            <h2>Easy to assemble. Rock solid.
                </h2>
            <p>
                    Modulos surface is comprised of Modules - surface tiles each capable of being connected to another one in any direction providing you with infinite possibilities.

                    We have refined a super-simple, yet absolutely stable connection system for the modules, which makes assembly a breeze. The only tool you need is a hex key - which is included in your module's box. Simply connect the modules with wooden pins, fasten them together with a simple screw system and you're ready to go! And the desk, of course, holds weight just as any other desk would!
